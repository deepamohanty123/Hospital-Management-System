  <h1><i>Our Story</i></h1>
  <div class="part6">
    <div class="P1">
      <p><i>The roots of the pharmaceutical industry lie back with the
          apothecaries and pharmacies that offered traditional remedies as
          far back as the middle ages, offering a hit-and-miss range of treatments
          based on centuries of folk knowledge.
          But the industry as we understand it today really has its origins
          in the second half of the 19th century.
           Whilst the scientific revolution
          of the 17th century had spread ideas of rationalism and experimentation,
          and the industrial revolution had 
          transformed the production of goods in the late 18th century,
          the marrying of the two concepts for the
           benefit of human health was a comparatively late development.
          Merck in Germany was possibly the earliest company to move in this direction.
          Originating as a pharmacy founded in Darmstadt in 1668, it was in 1827
          that Heinrich Emanuel Merck began the transition towards an industrial
          and scientific concern, by manufacturing and selling alkaloids.
          Switzerland also rapidly developed a home-grown pharmaceutical
          industry in the second half of the 19th century.</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="P2"><i>
        Previously a
        centre of the trade in textiles and dyes, Swiss manufacturers
        gradually began to realise their dyestuffs had antiseptic and other
        properties and began to market them as pharmaceuticals, in contrast
        to the origin in pharmacies of other enterprises. Switzerland’s total
        lack of patent laws led to it being accused of being a “pirate state”
        in the German Reichstag. Sandoz, CIBA-Geigy, Roche and the Basel hub
        of the pharmaceutical industry all have their roots in this boom.
        The unregulated nature of the trade in medicines
        during this period ensured there was a far less strict
        delineation between 'pharmaceutical' and 'chemical' industries
        than we have nowadays. These companies focused as much on cod liver oil,
        toothpaste, citric acid for soft drinks, and hair gel as on prescription
        medicines, as well as selling products like heroin on the over-the-counter market.</i></p>
